# Project: Command Pattern and Plugins Homework 5

## Introduction

This project focuses on the development of an interactive command-line application that operates continuously, transitioning from a single-execution script to a fully functional application. Through this assignment, I explore the command pattern, learn how to dynamically load commands using a simple plugin architecture, and understand the appropriate use of exceptions versus conditional statements to manage invalid data inputs.

### Submission Requirements

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Watch the lecture on the main/command branch, which covers REPL and the command pattern. [Instructor Video: Command Pattern Lecture](https://youtu.be/3DVUN091T5g). Integrate these concepts with your existing program to add four basic commands: add, subtract, multiply, and divide, making your calculator interactive.

2. **(Bonus) Implement a Menu Command:**
   - Create a menu command that displays available commands from the command dictionary at the application's start and when the user types "menu." This is a self-guided challenge to deepen your understanding of dynamic command integration.

3. **Testing and Code Coverage:**
   - With the calculator commands integrated, update and expand your tests to achieve 100% test coverage, ensuring your program's functionality is fully verified.

4. **Plugin Architecture:**
   - View the lecture on implementing plugins [Instructor Video: Plugins Lecture](https://youtu.be/c2PmjazGW2w). Learn to refactor your program to automatically load plugins, facilitating easy command additions without manual updates.

5. **(Bonus) Explore Multiprocessing Capabilities:**
   - Investigate adding multiprocessing features to enable commands/plugins to run on separate cores. This enhancement is a forward-looking feature that prepares your application for future scalability and performance improvements.
